# Activity - 1: Basic HTML

In this activity, your aim is to prepare a simple website like the one shown in basic.png.

You will have to write your code in the basic.html file provided. Your HTML file should have the following tags:

(i) H1 and H2 headings

(ii) Paragraphs

(iii) Unordered List

(iv) Table and its tags

(v) Email address should be a link that moves to Compose Mail.

(vi) Footer Tag at the end will display your name.

(vii) Also, give a title to the website.



You can alter some of the text/content shown in the image. However, the elements and attributes have to be present as specified. This activity aims to help you learn how and where basic tags are used.

# Activity - 2: Let's Style

In this lab, we will focus on styling our simple web page. Your HTML code should be in advanced.html, and your CSS code should be in the styles.css file. Remember this activity is totally independent of the previous one, so you must create another HTML page.



Here are the specifications:

(i) There should be a title on the webpage, and advanced.html should have its styling linked to styles.css.

(ii) There should be a header. Change the text alignment to center.

(iii) Include a navigation bar on the webpage. Change the background color of the navigation bar.

(iv) Also, add a footer in your document. The text color of the footer should be white.

(v) Attach id=bad_jokes to the footer. The text color of the footer should be white. Remember, the styling of the footer should be based on this id and not on the tag itself.

(vi) To make things difficult, add a form in the Contact Me section. It should have a field for name, email, message, and a submit button.



A sample website is given in advanced.png.

# Activity - 3: CSE Trip Survey using HTML and CSS!

2. An input, using \<input\> tag and type = text and give them class Rating
--------The 2 questions are as under:
1. Q1: How would you rate the trip?
2. Q2: How would you rate the fun you had?
## CSS
1. The style.css file is already imported for you in the \<head\> section. 
2. Use inline CSS to align the \<h1\> heading text in the center. 
3. Use internal CSS to give lightpink as the background color to \<div\> container of id = formContainer. 
4. Use external CSS to give 50 px width to the \<input\> tag elements of class Rating. 
DO NOT TOUCH/MODIFY ANY PRE-WRITTEN CONTENT IN THE STYLE.CSS FILE.

After doing the HTML and CSS parts correctly, the webpage should look like this:-

# Activity - 4: Personal Website

Enough of basic stuff done, right? (Or it wasnt basic for you??) Well, anyways in this activity your goal is to design your personal website. Yes, you read that right. There is a templates folder, which has some screenshots on how your websites may look like.



Some of the essential features, which your website should have:

1. Four or more navigation options, including Home, Hobbies, Achievements and Contact sections.
2. A navigation bar at the top of the website, which should have all the options, and on clicking each option it should move to the respective webpage.
3. The Home section should have your image, with height and weight adjusted.
4. There should be a table showing your education.
5. The Contact web page should display your contact number and email id. Optionally you can attach links to your social media handles.
6. The Hobbies should have a list of activities you like to do, describing all of them.


There is a templates folder, which has some screenshots on how your website may look like. But use your own creativity and personalize it! You can also refer to other website for ideas. 

  

In today's lab or the next lab once you finish your website, show it to any TA to get some feedback and a score (will not count towards your grade, don't worry!) (You will not be able to run the autograder on your submissions. So, don't click on the Evaluate button.)



Write your code in personal_website.html and style_website.css
