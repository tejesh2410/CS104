(v) Email address should be a link which moves to Compose Mail.

(vi) Footer Tag at the end to display your name.

(vii) Also give a title to the website.



You can alter some of the text/content as shown in the image. However, the elements and attributes have to be present as specified. The objective of this activity is to help you learn how and where basic tags are used.

## Activity 2

In this lab we will focus on styling our simple web page. Your html code should be present in advanced.html and css code should be present in styles.css file. Remember this activity is totally independent from the previous one, so you need to create another html page.

Here are the specifications:

(i) There should be a title of the webpage and advanced.html should have its styling linked to styles.css.

(ii) There should be a header. Change the text alignment to center.

(iii) Include a navigation bar in the webpage. Change the background color of the navigation bar.

(iv) Also, add a footer in your document. The text color of the footer should be white.

(v) Attach id=”bad_jokes” to the footer.The text color of the footer should be white. Remember, the styling of the footer should be based on this id and not on the tag itself.

(vi) To make things difficult, add a form in the Contact Me section. It should have name, email and message fields along with a submit button.
